  "description": "Kang Jinhyeok, a gaming streamer and content creator, is the only person who has cleared the game, [Tower of Trials]. However, as the game’s popularity declines, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to continue making a living as a content creator. Jinhyeok prepares to end his 11-year-long relationship with the game and say goodbye to his humble group of subscribers. But on that very day, the Tower of Trials appears in reality with a message saying that humanity will perish unless all players clear each floor within 90 days. Jinhyeok, who knows the game better than anyone, decides to use his knowledge to his advantage and dominate the tower. It’s time to show everyone what a hardcore gamer can do!",
